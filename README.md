Datasets accessible at:
SMART (2019):
https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/mouse-whole-cortex-and-hippocampus-smart-seq
This data set includes single-cell transcriptomes from
multiple cortical areas and the hippocampal formation, including 76,533 total
cells. Samples were collected from dissections of brain regions from 8
week-old male and female mice, primarily from pan-GABAergic,
pan-glutamatergic, and pan-neuronal transgenic lines, with the addition of
more specific transgenic lines and some retrogradely-labeled cells in VISp
and ALM.


TenX (2020): https://portal.brain-map.org/atlases-and-data/rnaseq/mouse-whole-cortex-and-hippocampus-10x
This data set includes single-cell transcriptomes from multiple cortical
areas and the hippocampal formation, including 1,093,785 total cells. Samples
were collected from dissections of brain regions from ~8 week-old male and
female mice, from pan-neuronal transgenic lines.
